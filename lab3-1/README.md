# Exercise : Float Boxes
Flex boxes have been used for this type of layout for a long time, so I forgot about float. I got help from the lecture to break the float.

# Exercise : Menu
It was easy.


# Exercise : Layout2
It was difficult. I finished with help of the solution on the next slide.

# Exercise : More Floats
It was very difficult. Most of them were done with help of the solutions.
